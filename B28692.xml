            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS Against the BILL For making the Rivers</hi> AYRE <hi>and</hi> CALDER <hi>in the</hi> West-Riding <hi>of the County of</hi> York; <hi>Navigable.</hi>
            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>Shewing that the same will not only utterly ruine the Trade of the City, and great part of the County of <hi>York,</hi> but will likewise destroy much of the Coal Trade, from <hi>Newcastle</hi> and <hi>Sunderland;</hi> and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Navigation, and breeding of Seamen, and can be in no sort beneficial to the Nation in general, or Manufactures thereof; tending only to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage of the Ʋndertakers.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>Humbly Offered to the Consideration of the Honourable House of COMMONS.</opener>
            <p>THIS <hi>BILL</hi> being founded upon the like Popular Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with that, which was lately Brought in for the making the River <hi>Dun</hi> Navigable. Several of the Reasons against that Bill, are directly Applicable in this Case: As to All, but what is now Pretended for the encrease and encouragement of the Woollen Manufacture.</p>
            <p>As to which the only Reason or Argument Pretended, Is, That by making these Rivers Navigable, the Carriage of Cloth will be Cheaper than heretofore, by Land Carriage; and more Cloth Vended.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which, it is to be Considered, That the Way of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from <hi>Leeds</hi> (which is the Chief place of Manufacture) to <hi>Hull,</hi> is either by the City of <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>Selby:</hi> And till of late years, the constant Carriage was by <hi>York,</hi> and at this time all the Merchants of <hi>York,</hi> bring thither by Land Carriage, all their Cloth from <hi>Leeds,</hi> which costs
<pb facs="tcp:186033:2"/>about Six shillings, for the value of One Hundred Pounds worth of Cloth to <hi>York,</hi> and Eighteen pence from thence to <hi>Hull.</hi> And the Undertakers under this Bill, declare that they expect at least Five shillings and Six pence for Carriage of the same Quantity of Cloth, by their New inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Water Carriage, which is only about Two shillings saved in One Hundred Pound, and that is so inconsiderable a Charge, as cannot upon that account hinder the making and Vending of more Cloth.</p>
            <p>But the Design of this Bill, tending to the utter Destruction of the Trade of the City of <hi>York,</hi> by making use of such New Rivers for the Carriage of other Commodities, which heretofore came to, and were Vended there: The Argument will Lye in Competition of Place, whether <hi>Leeds</hi> or those Adjacent parts, whose Trade hath been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed first and advanced by the Merchants of <hi>York,</hi> and thereby Grown up to be Opulent, shall be Encouraged to take all the Trade to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from <hi>York</hi> (so Ancient as to be Reputed the second City of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the support of which is only by Trade and Benefit of the River <hi>Ouze,</hi> the Tide of which River (in Case of such New Rivers which come in nearer towards the Sea by Ten Miles) will be Lost, or so Lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it cannot be Possible for <hi>York</hi> to have any Water-Carriage at all.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>York</hi> stands as the Center of the whole County for Trade, and there is yearly sent from thence, for the City of <hi>London</hi> and beyond the Seas, above 40000 Firkins of Butter; many Thousand Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Corn, and Rape Seed; and Great Quantities of Lead, Tallow, and other Commodities, all of the Growth and Product of that County; which cannot be otherwise transported but by the River of <hi>Ouze,</hi> so that to Prejudice the said River, will in Consequence not only Destroy the said Trade of the City, but also great part of the County will suffer in not Vending the said Commodities.</p>
            <p>Besides the Merchants of the City of <hi>York,</hi> vend most of their Foreign Commodities to <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Cheshire,</hi> which Enables them the more in Trade, and this will be also utterly lost to them, and gained to <hi>Leeds,</hi> by making the River <hi>Aire</hi> Navigable, and that but only by coming nearer to those Counties by about Twenty Miles Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Carriage, and putting the City of <hi>York</hi> in such Condition, as not to have any Water Carriage for themselves.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be Pretended that the Making of those Rivers of <hi>Ayre</hi> and <hi>Calder</hi> Navigable, would be for the encouragement of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Breeding of Seamen— It is so far from any Colour of Reason, That there Lying so many Collieries, upon the said Rivers of <hi>Ayre,</hi> and <hi>Calder;</hi> The making of them Navigable will enable the Undertakers, to fell those Coals so Cheap, that no Ships can Afford to bring any Coals from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> to Sell within the Rivers of <hi>Humber,</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> where above Two Hundred Ships Lading are Sold Yearly; by which Means such Part of that Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Trade, which is the Great Nursery of Seamen, will be lost.</p>
